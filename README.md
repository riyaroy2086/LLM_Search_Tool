# Question Answering System for News Articles

## Overview

This project aims to create a Question Answering (QA) system specifically designed for news articles. The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide relevant answers to user queries based on the content of news articles. Here's a step-by-step overview of how the system works:

### Data Collection

- Gather a dataset of news articles along with associated questions and answers. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the QA model.

### Preprocessing

- Clean and preprocess the news articles. Tasks may include removing irrelevant information, tokenization, and stemming to prepare the data for model training.

### Question Answering Model

- Train or use a pre-trained QA model. Modern approaches, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), are commonly employed due to their ability to understand context and relationships in language.

### Fine-tuning (Optional)

- Fine-tune the model on a specific dataset if needed. This step helps the model adapt to the unique characteristics of the news articles in your collection.

### User Input

- Allow users to input their questions related to a given news article.

### Processing

- Process the user input by applying similar preprocessing steps as used during training.

### Inference

- Use the trained model to infer the most relevant answer to the user's question based on the content of the news article.

### Output

- Display the predicted answer to the user.

## Getting Started

To get started with this QA system, follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a dataset of news articles, questions, and answers. This dataset will be used for training and evaluating the QA model.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the news articles using the provided scripts in the `preprocessing` directory.

3. **Training the Model:**
   - Train the QA model using the training script in the `training` directory. Alternatively, use a pre-trained model from popular libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers.

4. **User Interface:**
   - Implement a user interface that allows users to input questions and receive answers. The `user_interface` directory provides a basic example.
